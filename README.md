# Remote FTP
FTP/FTPS/SFTP client for Atom.io

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icetee/remote-ftp/master/screenshot.png "Screenshot")

## Getting started

1. **Open** an existing **project** or create a new one (File -> Open folder...)
2. **Open** remote-ftp **sidebar** (Packages -> Remote FTP -> Toggle)
3. **Create a configuration file** for your project (Packages -> Remote FTP -> Create (s)FTP config file)
4. Once connected you should be seeing the content of the remote connection
5. **All** basic **commands** (`connect`, `disconnect`, ...) are **available from** the **sidebar context menu** and the Command Palette

Tip: **Create an ignore file** to prevent your sensitive information from getting synced to your host (Packages -> Remote FTP -> Create ignore file)

## Keyboard shortcuts

We all know that some handy commands can make our daily task easier, this are meant to do that, be aware that the action of any of them could overwrite or be over written by any other plugin.

## How to use .ftpignore?

This package use the [ignore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ignore) npm package. Which covers the operation of fully [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

## How use multiproject mode?

It is a very alpha / beta version. For the time being, only 1 project is supported at one time.
